# About

This project aims to create an extremly simple way how to print on a 3D Prusa Mini printer in a private network.

For a printer which is in a network where it's possible to setup a public server, Octoprint (see www.octoprint.org) may be a better solution.
However if this is not the case, Octoprint cannot be used and this project provides an alternative in such case.

You can learn more about the structure of the project in the programmer's documentation.

# How to use it

## Setting up server

It's required to host this Django project on a public server.

First clone this repositary `git clone https://www.github.com/GordonHoklinder/remote-print/`.

Then set up the server. I found this guide useful https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-django-with-postgres-nginx-and-gunicorn-on-ubuntu-16-04.

## Setting up raspberry

Connect Raspberry
